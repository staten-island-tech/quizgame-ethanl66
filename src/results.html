                            out a room
                            in a
                            rickety old
                            building in Akihabara, where he indulges himself in his hobby of inventing prospective
                            "future
                            gadgets" with fellow lab members: Mayuri Shiina, his air-headed childhood friend, and
                            Hashida
                            Itaru,
                            a perverted hacker nicknamed "Daru." The three pass the time by tinkering with their most
                            promising
                            contraption yet, a machine dubbed the "Phone Microwave," which performs the strange function
                            of
                            morphing bananas into piles of green gel. \n \nThough miraculous in itself, the phenomenon
                            doesn\'t
                            provide anything concrete in Okabe\'s search for a scientific breakthrough; that is, until
                            the
                            lab
                            members are spurred into action by a string of mysterious happenings before stumbling upon
                            an
                            unexpected successâ€”the Phone Microwave can send emails to the past, altering the flow of
                            history. \n
                            \nAdapted from the critically acclaimed visual novel by 5pb. and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate
                            takes
                            Okabe
                            through the depths of scientific theory and practicality. Forced across the diverging
                            threads of
                            past and present, Okabe must shoulder the burdens that come with holding the key to the
                            realm of
                            time. \n \n[Written by MAL Rewrite]</p><br>
